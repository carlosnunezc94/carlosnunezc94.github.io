I am a Data Scientist with experience in the dating industry, particularly in Trust and Safety. I have a passion for using data to make a positive impact on the world, and I believe that dating apps have the potential to do just that. In my current role at Match Group, I am responsible for developing and implementing BI solutions used for decision-making. I also work on projects to improve the user experience and safety of the platform.
