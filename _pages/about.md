# About Me
I am a Data Scientist with experience in the dating industry, particularly in Trust and Safety. I have a passion for using data to make a positive impact on the world, and I believe that dating apps have the potential to do just that. In my current role at Match Group, I am responsible for developing and implementing BI solutions used for decision-making. I also work on projects to improve the user experience and safety of the platform.

I am proficient in data storytelling, A/B testing, and reporting. I am also familiar with a variety of data science tools and ML techniques. I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual, and I am always looking for new challenges.

I am currently on an H1-B visa, and I am eligible to work in the United States.
